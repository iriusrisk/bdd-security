BDD-Security is a security testing framework that uses Behaviour Driven Development concepts to create self-verifying security specifications.

The framework is essentially a set of [Cucumber-JVM](https://cucumber.io/) features that are pre-wired with [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/), [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), [SSLyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze) and [Tenable's Nessus scanner](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner).

It tests Web Applications and API's from an external point of view and does not require access to the target source code.
